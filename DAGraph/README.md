Directed Acylic Graph with Weights

Algos
- BFS
- DFS
- Cycle Detection
    - DFS with Visited and Visiting
    - if vertex in visiting then cycle is detect
    - if vertex in visited, then from another path we have reached but isn't a cycle

- Topological Sorting
    - No Cycle
    - Reverse Result of DFS
